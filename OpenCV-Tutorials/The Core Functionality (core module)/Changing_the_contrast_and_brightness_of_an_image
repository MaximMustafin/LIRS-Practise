[Image Processing]
- A general image processing operator is a function
that takes one or more input images and produces an output image.
- Image transforms can be seen as:
   1)Point operators (pixel transforms)
   2)Neighborhood (area-based) operators
   
[Pixel Transforms]
In this kind of image processing transform, 
each output pixel's value depends on only the corresponding
input pixel value (plus, potentially, some globally collected 
information or parameters).
Examples of such operators include brightness and contrast 
adjustments as well as color correction and transformations.
