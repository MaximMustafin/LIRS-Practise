Mask operations on matrices are quite simple. 
The idea is that we recalculate each pixel's value in an image 
according to a mask matrix (also known as kernel). 
This mask holds values that will adjust how much influence 
neighboring pixels (and the current pixel) have on the new pixel 
value. From a mathematical point of view we make a weighted 
average, with our specified values.
