The Fourier Transform will decompose an image into itssinus and cosines components. In other words,it will transform an image from its spatial domain toits frequency domain. The idea is that any function may beapproximated exactly with the sum of infinite sinus and cosines functions. The Fourier Transform is a way how to do this.An application idea would be to determine the geometricalorientation present in the image.For example, let us find out if a text is horizontal or not?Looking at some text you'll notice that the text lines sort of form also horizontal lines and the letters form sort of vertical lines. These two main components of a text snippet may be also seen in case of the Fourier transform. Let us use this horizontal and this rotated image about a text.
