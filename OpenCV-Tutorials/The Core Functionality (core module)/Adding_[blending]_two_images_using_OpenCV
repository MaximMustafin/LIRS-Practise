From our previous tutorial, we know already a bit of
Pixel operators. An interesting dyadic (two-input) operator is
the linear blend operator:

g(x)=(1−α)f0(x)+αf1(x)
By varying α from 0→1 this operator can be used to perform
a temporal cross-dissolve between two images or videos,
as seen in slide shows and film productions (cool, eh?)
